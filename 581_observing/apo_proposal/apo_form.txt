INSTITUTIONAL ID NUMBER:

DESCRIPTIVE TITLE: K2-138 Transit Timing Follow-up

PI: Tom wagg

Co-Is:

OBSERVER(S):

UNCERTIFIED/UNTRAINED OBSERVERS: None

EXTERNAL COLLABORATORS: None

CONTACT INFORMATION:

HALF NIGHTS OR HOURS REQUESTED:
Dark - 2 halves

INSTRUMENT: ARCTIC
FILTERS: ARCTIC - H-alpha

OBSERVING MODE: On site
SCIENTIFIC SCHEDULE CONSTRAINTS:
This proposal is for measuring exoplanet transit photometry, so we must 
observe during the transit events (dates/times listed in proposal). Since 
transits of the targets are 1.95 and 2.34 hours respectively, we request a total of 3 hours for 
each transit observation in order to measure the stellar flux before and after the transit.
