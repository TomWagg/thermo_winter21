OBSERVER(S):

UNCERTIFIED/UNTRAINED OBSERVERS: None

EXTERNAL COLLABORATORS: None

CONTACT INFORMATION:

HALF NIGHTS OR HOURS REQUESTED:
Dark- 2 halves
Grey- 1 half
Bright- 1 half

INSTRUMENT: ARCTIC
FILTERS: ARCTIC - H-alpha

OBSERVING MODE: On site
OBSERVING SCHEDULE CONSTRAINTS:
This proposal is for measuring exoplanet transit photometry, so we must 
observe during the transit events (dates/times listed in proposal). Since 
transits of this target last 2.6 hours, we request a total of 4 hours for 
each transit observation in order to measure the stellar flux before and 
after the transit.


SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:
ARCTIC observations will be done with the diffuser.
BRIEF SCIENCE JUSTIFICATION:
A small number of transiting exoplanets exhibit residual photometric 
signals during transit events. One source of these anomalies is starspots 
on the surface of a transiting planetâs host star, which impart positive 
flux anomalies on transit light curves during transits. The amplitude, 
shape, duration, color and timing of these spot occultations can reveal 
properties of the spots such as spot lifetimes, temperature contrasts, 
sizes, and their distribution on the stellar surface.
This team has led detailed spot modeling efforts for two systems observed 
by Kepler. In Davenport et al. (2016, in prep), starspot occultations in 
the well-aligned Kepler-17 system allowed the authors to study time 
evolution of the starspots. In Morris et al. (2016, in prep), the authors 
used the misaligned system HAT- P-11 to study the latitude distribution of 
spots. The HAT-P-11 photometry, and additional chromospheric activity 
measurements from the CaII H & K S-index, suggest that the star was near 
activity maximum during the Kepler mission (2009-2013) and may be 
approaching activity minimum.
We plan to observe starspots of another star â WASP-85 A / EPIC 
201862715 (Brown, 2015). This G5 star has Teff = 5685 K and its planet is 
a 1.09 MJ hot Jupiter with orbital period 2.655 d. This star was observed 
by K2 in short-cadence mode, which revealed spot occultations (MoËcnik et 
al., 2016). We propose to observe this system with the ARC 3.5 m to 
measure the spot occultations at short-cadence and high photometric 
precision, and in a different filter band from Kepler, to measure the bulk 
spot colors and constrain the spot temperatures.
We propose to also gather ARCES echelle spectra of EPIC 201862715 so that 
this star can be incorpo- rated into the starspot spectra analysis begin 
in 2016 Q3, since we can independently estimate the spot temperatures with 
both spectroscopy and photometry via the spot occultation technique.
